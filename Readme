project_name: "E57 to 3D Mesh Converter üöÄ"

description: "A powerful web tool that transforms raw E57 point cloud files into structured 3D meshes (PLY & OBJ) with just a few clicks!"

solution_approach:
  - Users upload `.e57` files containing raw point cloud data.
  - We extract 3D coordinates (X, Y, Z) from the uploaded file.
  - The extracted points undergo **Statistical Outlier Removal (SOR)** to remove noise.
  - **Normals are estimated** for better surface reconstruction.
  - The **Ball Pivoting Algorithm (BPA)** is applied to generate high-quality meshes.
  - The final outputs are available in `.PLY` (point cloud) and `.OBJ` (3D mesh) formats.
  - Users can **preview and download** files using an interactive **Streamlit UI**.

libraries_used:
  backend:
    Flask: "Handles file uploads, processing, and API requests."
    Flask-CORS: "Enables Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) for frontend-backend communication."
    PyE57: "Extracts and processes point cloud data from `.e57` files."
    Open3D: "Handles point cloud visualization, noise filtering, and 3D mesh generation."
    NumPy: "Performs efficient numerical operations and data handling."

  frontend:
    Streamlit: "Provides an interactive and user-friendly UI for file upload and preview."

algorithms_used:
  - Statistical Outlier Removal (SOR):  
      description: |
        A preprocessing technique used to clean up point cloud data by removing noise.
        It works by analyzing each point‚Äôs distance to its neighbors. If a point is too far
        from its nearby neighbors, it's likely an outlier and gets removed.

        This is important because noisy or scattered points can distort the final 3D mesh.
        SOR ensures a cleaner point cloud, leading to more accurate and realistic mesh reconstructions.

        üîπ How it works:
          - For every point, compute the distance to its *k* nearest neighbors.
          - Calculate the mean distance and standard deviation of all these distances.
          - Any point whose average distance is above a threshold (typically mean + Œ± * std) is marked as an outlier and removed.

  - Ball Pivoting Algorithm (BPA):  
      description: |
        An advanced surface reconstruction technique that builds 3D meshes from a clean point cloud.
        BPA simulates a ball rolling over the surface of the points. Whenever the ball touches three
        points without enclosing any others, a triangle is created.

        This technique creates watertight, high-quality 3D surfaces, ideal for visualizations and 3D printing.

        üîπ How it works:
          - Estimate normals at each point (direction of surface).
          - Place a virtual ball of fixed radius in the point cloud.
          - Roll the ball along the cloud, connecting triplets of points to form triangles.
          - Repeat until the surface is complete.

attention_grabbing_notes:
  - üí° **Got a raw point cloud? Convert it into a stunning 3D model now!**
  - ‚ö†Ô∏è If your `.e57` file has very few points, meshing might not work well. Try a denser file!
  - üîß **Adjust BPA parameters** in the code for finer mesh details if needed.
  - üöÄ Designed for **hackathons, researchers, engineers, and 3D enthusiasts**!
