project_name: "E57 to 3D Mesh Converter üöÄ"
description: "A powerful web tool that transforms raw E57 point cloud files into beautiful 3D meshes (PLY & OBJ) with just a few clicks!"

solution_approach:
  - Our tool helps users convert `.e57` files (raw point cloud data) into structured 3D models.
  - We extract the 3D coordinates (X, Y, Z) from the uploaded file.
  - The extracted points are processed using `Open3D` to estimate normals and create a clean 3D mesh.
  - We use the **Ball Pivoting Algorithm (BPA)** to generate high-quality meshes.
  - The final outputs are available in `.PLY` (point cloud) and `.OBJ` (3D mesh) formats.
  - Users can **view a preview and download the files** instantly from an interactive UI built with **Streamlit**.

implementation_details:
  backend:
    - **Flask**: The engine that handles file uploads, processing, and conversions.
    - **PyE57**: Extracts point cloud data from `.e57` files.
    - **Open3D**: Used for point cloud visualization and creating 3D meshes.
    - **NumPy**: Helps with numerical operations and data handling.

  frontend:
    - **Streamlit**: A clean, interactive UI that lets users upload, process, and download files easily.

  file_handling:
    - **Uploads** are stored in the `uploads/` folder.
    - **PLY files** (point cloud) are saved in `ply_files/`.
    - **OBJ files** (3D mesh) are stored in `mesh_files/`.

execution_steps:
  1. Install the required tools:
     pip install flask flask-cors open3d numpy pye57 streamlit
     ```
  2. Start the backend:
     python backend.py
     ```
  3. Launch the Streamlit UI:
     streamlit run frontend.py
     ```
  4. Open the app in your browser.
  5. **Upload an `.e57` file** ‚Üí Wait a few seconds.
  6. **Preview and download** the generated 3D model in `.PLY` and `.OBJ` formats.

dependencies:
  - **Python 3.8+** (Make sure you have Python installed)
  - **Flask** (For running the backend)
  - **Flask-CORS** (To allow cross-origin requests)
  - **Open3D** (For handling 3D point clouds)
  - **NumPy** (For data processing)
  - **PyE57** (To read `.e57` files)
  - **Streamlit** (For a smooth user experience)

expected_output:
  - You can **upload an `.e57` file** and get a structured 3D model.
  - The tool will generate **PLY (point cloud)** and **OBJ (3D mesh)** formats.
  - You‚Äôll see a **preview of the 3D model** before downloading.
  - Everything happens **fast, efficiently, and in just a few clicks**.

attention_grabbing_notes:
  - üí° **Got a raw point cloud? Convert it into a stunning 3D model now!**
  - ‚ö†Ô∏è If your `.e57` file has very few points, meshing might not work well. Try a denser file!
  - üîß **Adjust BPA parameters** in the code for finer mesh details if needed.
  - üöÄ Designed for **hackathons, researchers, engineers, and 3D enthusiasts**!
