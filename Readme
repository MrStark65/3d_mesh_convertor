project_name: "E57 to 3D Mesh Converter üöÄ"
description: "A powerful web tool that transforms raw E57 point cloud files into structured 3D meshes (PLY & OBJ) with just a few clicks!"

solution_approach:
  - Users upload `.e57` files containing raw point cloud data.
  - We extract 3D coordinates (X, Y, Z) from the uploaded file.
  - The extracted points undergo **Statistical Outlier Removal (SOR)** to remove noise.
  - **Normals are estimated** for better surface reconstruction.
  - The **Ball Pivoting Algorithm (BPA)** is applied to generate high-quality meshes.
  - The final outputs are available in `.PLY` (point cloud) and `.OBJ` (3D mesh) formats.
  - Users can **preview and download** files using an interactive **Streamlit UI**.

libraries_used:
  backend:
    Flask: "Handles file uploads, processing, and API requests."
    Flask-CORS: "Enables Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) for frontend-backend communication."
    PyE57: "Extracts and processes point cloud data from `.e57` files."
    Open3D: "Handles point cloud visualization, noise filtering, and 3D mesh generation."
    NumPy: "Performs efficient numerical operations and data handling."

  frontend:
    Streamlit: "Provides an interactive and user-friendly UI for file upload and preview."

algorithms_used:
  - **Statistical Outlier Removal (SOR)**:  
      - Removes noise from raw point clouds.  
      - Uses **neighbor-based filtering** to eliminate points that deviate significantly from the local mean.  
      - Ensures a cleaner 3D mesh for better reconstruction.  

  - **Ball Pivoting Algorithm (BPA)**:  
      - Converts **filtered** point clouds into structured 3D meshes.  
      - Works by **rolling a virtual ball** over the point cloud to connect nearby points into a surface.  
      - Produces **high-quality, smooth 3D meshes**.

execution_steps:
  1. Install dependencies:
     ```bash
     pip install flask flask-cors open3d numpy pye57 streamlit
     ```
  2. Start the backend:
     ```bash
     python backend.py
     ```
  3. Launch the frontend:
     ```bash
     streamlit run frontend.py
     ```
  4. Open the app in your browser.
  5. **Upload an `.e57` file** and wait a few seconds.
  6. **Preview and download** the generated 3D model in `.PLY` and `.OBJ` formats.

dependencies:
  - Python 3.8+
  - Flask (Backend API)
  - Flask-CORS (For cross-origin requests)
  - Open3D (For handling 3D point clouds)
  - NumPy (For data processing)
  - PyE57 (To read `.e57` files)
  - Streamlit (Frontend UI)

expected_output:
  - **Upload an `.e57` file** ‚Üí Get a structured 3D model.
  - The tool generates **PLY (point cloud)** and **OBJ (3D mesh)** formats.
  - Users see a **preview of the 3D model** before downloading.
  - Everything happens **fast, efficiently, and in just a few clicks**.

attention_grabbing_notes:
  - üí° **Got a raw point cloud? Convert it into a stunning 3D model now!**
  - ‚ö†Ô∏è If your `.e57` file has very few points, meshing might not work well. Try a denser file!
  - üîß **Adjust BPA parameters** in the code for finer mesh details if needed.
  - üöÄ Designed for **hackathons, researchers, engineers, and 3D enthusiasts**!
